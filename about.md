@def title="About me"

I'm a young developer and researcher.
Software development is my passion, as I've been involved in it since 2012.
Currently, my main programming interests are **Julia**, **C++** and **Python**.
You can see my own repositories and the repositories that I contributed to on **[GitHub](https://github.com/zdroid)**.

Science is the other side of my coin.
I've done several physics and astronomy projects in the **[Petnica Science Center](http://petnica.rs/)**.
My proudest achievement is taking part in the 13th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, **[IOAA 2019](http://www.ioaa2019.hu/)**.

Being centered on one field only is far from good in my opinion.
That's why my interests are as diverse as biology, history and politics.
I also like to clear my mind by going out with friends or listening to upbeat music.

If you are interested in doing a research or software project together, you can always contact me at

Don't hestitate, it can be related to any field.
